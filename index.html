    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>I am a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp, a 9-week intensive that teaches web development. During those 9 weeks I fell deeply in love with coding and the desire to continuously learn. I enjoy problem solving and coding has made the possible on so many new levels and languages. I would like to be on a team where I am pushed, can learn and have the ability to contribute.</p>

    <h2>browsin'</h2>
    <p>browsin' provides users with an efficient way to search streaming movies and shows based on their subscriptions. Simplicity of the software and speed were top priorities for our team on this project. We decided to implement React as a front-end and I jumped at the opportunity. I wrote in React and used Javascript, jQuery and Ajax to round it out. Additionally, I was responsible for the user model/controller and authentication of that user.</p>
    <h2>DoBoCo Source</h2>
    <p>DoBoCo Source is a platform for organizing resources, much like Reddit or Hacker News. This project was especially fun because we were creating a resource for past, present and future students at DBC find helpful websites during the 9 weeks. For this project I wrote the Javascript, jQuery and Ajax calls for the front-end in addition to the controller and model for searching the database. </p>
