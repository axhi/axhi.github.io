Woah, what a three week period. DBC has proved every bit exciting as I thought it would be. I have felt happy, angry, sad, excited, challenged, comforted, loved and basically any other emotion over the past 3 weeks. Today we were assessed on our understanding of the Phase 1 fundamentals and if the instructor's felt we were ready to move onto the next part of the program. 

I think a lot of people are extremely scared of this because they see it as a pass/fail type situation. The truth of the matter is, this place exists to make the individual the best possible entry level development candidate they can be. DBC is clearly a business, but they are truly here to make sure you get your value out of the program. If someone has gone through 3 weeks and isn't really ready to move on, that person shouldn't really want to move on...to be honest. You aren't here to get a 'grade' or a diploma, you are here to try and level yourself with the playing field. You are going up against CS grads that can put that exceptional line on their resume.

Someone from Phase 2 said today, "If I have not learned everything they taught me in this phase, I don't want to move on to the next one." It is, in a nutshell, as simple as that. For any incoming boots or prospective boots-please remember this. Not moving on is not easy. You are left behind as all your new-found friends are moving on. There are probably many emotions aside from that running through your mind as well; "That's another 3 weeks without pay.", "I have a family, they need me." and many other thoughts. 

I was fortunate enough to get a firm grasp on all the materials presented to me in Phase 1, but am seeing a few of my cohortmates repeating. I just want them to know that no one thinks they are inadequate and your Bobolink family will always be here for any help/advice. In the end, we all came here for the same intentions and will leave here at the same level.
