Hi there!
 
My background has me dabbling in all these: communications, marketing, business, hot dogs, paintball, video editing, video production, project management, web development, graphic design, app development, print layout design, snowboarding and much much more. Those keywords have applied to my job/education for the past 10 years. I graduated with my B.S. from University of Wisconsin in Communications, an A.A.S. in Video and Motion Graphics, as well as an M.B.A. from University of Wisconsin - Madison.

I am a graduate of Dev Bootcamp, a 9 week intensive specializing in teaching newcomers how to learn, more than anything. 

I'll just get this out in the open so you know it and I don't have to bring it up...I am addicted to teen dramas. Yes, I love everything on the CW Network. To answer your first few questions, "That most definitely includes Vampire Diaries, 90210 and Gossip Girl.
